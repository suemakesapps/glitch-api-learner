API Learner
===========

Hello! :wave: Welcome to the API Learner app. :school_satchel: By following the instructions below, you'll learn a little about how APIs work and make an open source project contribution at the same time! :boom:

> You can read this tutorial on either Glitch or GitHub.

___Hang On - What is an API?___

We use APIs to access data from applications, for example where data is stored in a database and we want to use it in a mobile or web app. 

Imagine you had a shop :convenience_store: and wanted to access your database of product information from both a website :globe_with_meridians: and a mobile app :iphone: - you could create an API that would provide access to the product info and that you could call from both the site and the app. That way the API could handle the detail of how the data should be accessed and so on.

APIs provide __endpoints__ to fetch and update data. In this app we're only using `GET` endpoints - these allow you to fetch data to display or use in your client app, but a real API will often have additional types of endpoint to add new data or to update existing data. In the shop example, you might have an endpoint that would return the current list of available products.

___Hang On  - What's this Open Source thing?___

In an open source software project, you can access and repurpose the source code. This means that open source projects can be worked on by communities of people, and can be remixed in all sorts of creative ways. They also make great learning resources if you're trying to get into coding, for example, [you can see a ton of source code for software projects managed by organisations like Mozilla on GitHub](https://github.com/mozilla/).

Even if you become a developer and end up working on software that isn't open source, you'll likely be collaborating as part of a team, so you'll find a lot of the same skills and processes apply.

## Learn by Contributing

__OK let's get stuck in and learn about APIs by adding an endpoint and remixing an open source project.__

The project we're working on is hosted on Glitch at [api-learner.glitch.me](https://api-learner.glitch.me) but we're going to manage contributions on GitHub. In GitHub you'll make a copy of the project, work on your additions in your copy, test it out on Glitch, and then get it merged back into the original one back on GitHub. This means that future learners using the project will see your contribution, and the live version on Glitch will be updated to include your contribution too.

You'll see the existing endpoints in the API listed in the project [homepage](https://api-learner.glitch.me) - click the first one on the list to see the result (ok so it isn't very exciting, it just returns some text but it's a real Node.js / Express API that uses server-side JavaScript, honest :nerd_face:). You're going to add one of your own that will also run on the server and return some data to display in the page.

### 1. Fork the Repo

First off we need to copy the project from GitHub. Go to the [Glitch API Learner](https://github.com/SueSmith/glitch-api-learner) repo and click __Fork__ (sign up for GitHub if you don't have an account yet).

![Fork Button](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6666370/57094447-76189800-6d08-11e9-9feb-d61b6ae564e0.png)

GitHub will create a copy of the repository in your own account - you can do whatever you like with this copy of the app and it won't affect the original, but later you'll submit your additions to be added to the original.


### 2. Import to Glitch

With your fork of the repo open in GitHub, click __Clone or download__, and copy the URL (it should end with `.git`) - you'll paste it into Glitch next.

![Fork URL](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6666370/57094448-76b12e80-6d08-11e9-8b42-dcc18d27e347.png)

In [Glitch](https://glitch.com), click __New Project__ and choose __Clone from Git Repo__.

![Glitch New Project](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6666370/57094775-3e5e2000-6d09-11e9-9b88-480bf10044e3.png)

Enter the URL you copied from your GitHub fork and click __OK__. Glitch will create a new project, importing the content from GitHub.

### 3. Add your Endpoint

Now you can play around with the API in Glitch and see the changes reflected in realtime (this is extremely cool btw :sunglasses: normally you would have to deal with a convoluted testing and deployment process to see this type of functionality running live).

With the editor for your new Glitch project open, select the `server.js` file. This is the Node.js / Express code that makes up the API. You'll see the existing endpoints in there, each one looks a bit like this:

```
app.get('/benormal', function(request, response) {
  response.send('writes code and words');
});
```

You'll be adding one of these to the app - let's take a look at the detail. The overall structure here is like this:

```
app.get(path, callback);
```

The `path` parameter is the name of the endpoint, so in the above example, this code will run when someone calls `https://api-learner.glitch.me/benormal`.

The `callback` parameter is what should execute when that path (and method - in this case `GET`) is called. In the example the parameter is specified as this function which receives `request` and `response` as parameters:

```
function(request, response) {
  response.send('writes code and words');
}
```

Inside the callback function the app uses the `response` parameter to send something to the _client_ - the _client_ is whatever application is calling the endpoint, in the case of this Glitch app it's typically just going to be the web browser, so if you visit [api-learner.glitch.me/benormal](https://api-learner.glitch.me/benormal), you'll see the text inside the function written out.

___Notes:___ 

* You can also call the endpoint from other clients, these could be applications in which you call the endpoint from your code - you can try it in a terminal using this command: `curl https://api-learner.glitch.me/benormal`). 
* You could use the `request` object to retrieve info about the request if necessary, for example if you wanted to pass info from clients in the request parameters, or in the body if you were e.g. updating or inserting new data into a database.

As you can see, all the endpoint does is return some text - in a real API the code would probably be querying a database but let's keep things simple for now. :innocent:

#### Your Endpoint

Right, let's get your endpoint added - in the `server.js` file, copy an existing `app.get` function and paste it under the rest (you'll see the place marked with a comment). Change two things:

* The endpoint name, `benormal` in the example - make it something that's likely to be unique to you so that we don't end up with duplicates, e.g. part of a domain you own (let's avoid punctuation symbols and just use letters).
* The text in the `send` call - change it to some interesting fact about you or whatever else you want to send back from the server.

Your addition should look something like this:

```
app.get('/youridentifier', function(request, response) {
  response.send('an interesting fact');
});
```

#### Add a Link

Add a link to your new endpoint in the app homepage - open `public/index.html`. You'll see the list of endpoints in there - add a new list item to link to yours. Include the endpoint name as the anchor element `href` and include whatever text you want to appear as the link inside the anchor body. It should look something like this:

```
<li>
  <a href="/youridentifier">name</a>
</li>
```

Check that your endpoint works by viewing the live Glitch app (click __Show Live__) and clicking your newly added link. If all goes according to plan you should see the text you wrote with the response object..! :grin:

_If your endpoint doesn't behave as expected and you need help, [create an issue in the original project GitHub repo](https://github.com/SueSmith/glitch-api-learner/issues) and I'll do my best to help troubleshoot._

### 4. Export to GitHub

OK so you've got a lovely new endpoint added to the API - don't keep it to yourself! By exporting it back to GitHub, you can get your addition merged into the original app.

In your Glitch project, select __Tools__ and choose __Git, Import, and Export__.

![Glitch Export](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6666370/57104302-e252c600-6d1f-11e9-9a2f-79d71f1a1ab4.png)

Select __Export to GitHub__ and enter ___your GitHub username___, followed by a slash, then the repo name.

![Export Options](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6666370/57104259-c7805180-6d1f-11e9-89e2-882df290ea45.png)
![Repo Details](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6666370/57104260-c7805180-6d1f-11e9-9655-585e31551660.png)

If the export is successful, your changes should be added to a new branch in your repository named `glitch`. Open the branch and create a pull request to merge it into your master branch.

### 5. Open a Pull Request

You can now ask for your new endpoint to be added to the original repo so that the list in there keeps growing. Open a pull request to merge the changes in your fork into `SueSmith/glitch-api-learner`.

_more detail to follow_

Thanks for submitting your endpoint to the project! :trophy: You'll get a message when it's been successfully merged and deployed back to Glitch. :flags: :tada:
